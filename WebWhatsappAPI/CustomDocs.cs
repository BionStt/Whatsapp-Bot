 *  * We do NOT give support to anyone that wants this API to send massive messages or similar.
 *  * We reserve the right to block any user of this repository that does not meet these conditions.

 * 
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Cloning the repository
 *  This can be done by simply going to %https://github.com/IwraStudios/Whatsapp-Bot and 
 *  clicking clone or download and downloading the zip file
 *  
 *  On linux machines it can be easier to do (although you won't have VS so how does that work?) \n
 *  git clone git@github.com:IwraStudios/Whatsapp-Bot.git \n
 *  or \n
 *  git clone %github.com/IwraStudios/Whatsapp-Bot.git \n
 *  
 *  \subsection step2 Step 2: Intergrating it into your own project
 *  ### Method 1: 
 *  Assuming you already have an VS C# project just right click on: Solution "your_project", in Solution Explorer  \n
 *  going to "Add >" and choosing existing project, then navigate to Whatsapp-Bot-master\\WebWhatsappAPI\\WebWhatsappAPI.csproj \n
 *  and clicking "Open" \n
 *  
 *  Now you can add it as a refrence by right-clicking Refrences in your project, going to Projects and checking the checkmark \n
 *  Aaaand your done. \n
 *  
 *  ### Method 2:
 *  As an alternative method you can open the project WhatsappBot.sln or WebWhatsappAPI.csproj and building it \n
 *  Then you can copy the .dll's and .exe's from %WebWhatsappAPI\\*\\bin\\*.dll and WebWhatsappAPI\*\\bin\\*.exe \n
 *  
 *  after you have done all that you can add the dll's as a refrence by going to refrences (right-click), clicking browse and going to the dll's \n
 *  when building your project you will have to either: \n
 *  copy the exe's to the %*\\bin\\ directory of your project \n
 *  or \n
 *  Adding a build step that does this for you \n
 *  
 *  \subsection step3 Step 3: Using it
 *  I could write an whole article about how to use the api but that is why these docs exist \n
 *  If you don't know how to do something look at the examples or the api docs \n
 *  
 *  If you, after you did that, still don't know how to do something go to %https://github.com/IwraStudios/Whatsapp-Bot/issues and create a new issue \n
